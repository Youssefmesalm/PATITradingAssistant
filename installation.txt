To install the PATI Trading Assistant from this ZIP file, do the following.


1. Open MetaTrader4, and click the File -> Open Data Folder.

2. (Optional Step) If you have an existing version of MetaTrader installed, and want to be cautious, make a backup copy of 
MQL4\Experts\PATITradingAssistant.ex4 and MQL4\Indicators\NewTradeIndicator.ex4. You can do this by copying those files to 
another folder, or by renaming them.

3. Double click on this ZIP folder to open it, and click and drag the MQL4 folder to the MetaTrader4 Data Folder. 
Drag it to an empy part of the window, not to one of the existing folders.

4. If there were existing copies of the PATI Trading Assistant installed, you will receive a message saying "The destination already has a 
file named 'PATITradingAssistant.ex4'"  Click "Replace the file in the destination".  (The exact wording of the message may be slightly different
depending on the version of Windows you are running.)

5. Close and restart MetaTrader4.  The new versions of the PATI Trading Assistant should now be available in the Experts navigator window, 
and the new version of the NewTradeIndicator in the Indicators navigator window.

6. From the Indicators folder of the Navigator view in MetaTrader4, drag the NewTradeIndicator onto ONE and ONLY ONE chart. 
From the Experts folder, drag the PATITradingAssistant onto each chart that you want to trade.
